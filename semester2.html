<p> 1/19/24 - This week was pretty busy. On Monday during Marthin Luther King Jr. day I was doing my pink slip. I finished it and I got it yesterday. Then the next day I had piano and then I went to my grandmas house to do some homework with my aunt. Then we made ooblek in this class. Then I went to dance on thrusday and now its friday.</p>

<p>1/26/24 - We started the mousetrap car project. Our goal is to make a car out of a moustrap and see which car goes the farthest. We have 2 ideas, on is to make the car with the same wheels and another one which there is one wheel on the back and it is 2 times bigger than the rest of the wheels. Next week I would like to start the BOM.</p>

<p> 2/5/24 - Last week we designed our CAD and we started slowly builidng the cars out of cardboard. Our goal for next week is that is to finish our first car and start working on the second car. The cad and the BOM should be completed by Friday. I went to play soccer with my friends. We played a 5 on 5 for 2 hours then we went to get wingstop after.</p>

<p> 2/13/24 - This week we started working on the finishing touches on our car and when we went to test our car, it almost snapped in half. Me and my partner had to stay a whole 20 minutes to make a whole other car and we actually got second place. I think that if we had more time obviously that we could plan everything out and do it better.</p>

<p> 2/26/24 - Our car was about a foot long, maybe even shorter. We made it in less then 20 minutes and we actually got second place. our first car went about 40-45 feet and our second car went about 60-65 feet. There was only one car infront of us and the only reason was because they put a lot more time and work into theirs, while we only put 15 minutes into our car. I would make our car longer and more sturdy without trying to add to much weight. </p>

<p> 3/4/24 - The project we are working on right now is the egg drop. Our goal is to drop an egg from a height height, but have the egg not shatter using given resources. Our idea is a parachute with a bunch of supportive padding where it is supposed to land. The scariest thing that could happen is that the parachute will not deploy in time and it will hit the ground.</p>

<p> 3/13/24 - Our eggdrop went suprisingly well even though our parachute didn't work. Our whole project landed upside down, but our egg still survived. The only reason that our egg slightly cracked only because when I opened the cap, the egg rolled and cracked on the ground. Over spring break i'm gonna hang out with my friends and my cousins and maybe just maybe go to Big Bear.</p>
